                <h2><em>Overview</em></h2>
        
                <p>It is no secret that women are demanding and gaining power and respect in today's society. It is more common to see women empowerment than ever before. As women work hard to gain respect and responsibility in everyday life, they do the same in their professional lives. However, it seems as though businesses have been slow to keep up with society's changes.</p>
        
        
                <p>Men have a long history of holding key positions within companies. It has only been just recently that women have started to hold worthy positions as well. Although this has been slow to occur, according to the S&amp;P 500, in the last ten years the number of <em>women holding Cheif Executive Officer positions has doubled</em>. This is a great accomplishment for not only women, but everyone in the workforce. This has proven that today's society accepts that women are just as capable as men in business positions.</p>
        
        
                <p>The slow change in inclusivity in power is shown through the technology industry. Forbes states that women earn 53&percnt; of all doctoral degrees, but only 25&percnt; in technology. They suggest to give out more scholarships to women who are looking to enter the STEM field and aim to hire more women in the STEM faculty at each school. Once this occurs and women gain hierarchy in technology companies, this will open the door for many other minorities in STEM.</p>
        
                <p>The few women who hold positions in technology companies are thriving. The ideas that can be gathered from more than just one demographic, can be life-changing. These women have given technology a new face and are implementing changes in their companies for the better. For example, one technology company, Citi, has prided itself on promoting women to major positions. The women in these positions are developing new programs that include building mobile investment features to creating new ideas for mentoring positions under Citi senior leaders.</p>

The more I get to know the company and its culture, the more excited I am about Citi’s commitment to diversity, specifically closing the gaps for women and minorities in technology.”  ~Lisa Cochran, Head of Operations Digitization and Technology, Global Consumer Banking</strong></em></p>
